# TEST-REPO
Temporary Repository For Test Codes

Please Make Sure to add directory or Folder of your name just as I did in above (Look at Dir. Kashif)
and add your files there!

## Nomenclature for Saving Files
- Fork This Repo.
- Upload Your Work in your forked repo
- Open a Pull Request in Original Repo
- Then wait for it to merge
This process is for practice
### You Should Submit Your Code with Your Directory Name by 12:30 PM  of 10th July 2021
